# Affiliate Onboarding Form – UX Flow

## Purpose of this document
This document describes the intended onboarding experience for affiliate provider groups purchasing Next Level's white-label program. It outlines customer-facing form language and the information required so Care Navigation, virtual providers, and operations teams can accurately support affiliate program members.

This document communicates product and operational intent, not technical implementation.
